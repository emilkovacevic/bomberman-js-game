## about
This was a personal project to practice javascript
It uses arrays of numbers to generate worlds

array num 0 - wall
array num 1 - breakable wall
array num 2 - free path
 
### game features 
The game has 3 worlds on every start random one is chosen.

You can create a new game world, copy the result code and create another world array. Paste in the generated values and add the name of new array to the worlds array in the bomberman.js file to run it. Next to other arrays

--- maybe I will implement a world importer one day.
